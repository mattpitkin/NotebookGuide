    "# Using a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is a Jupyter Notebook? Well, to quote their [website](https://jupyter.org/) _\"[A] Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\"_. What this means is that it provides an application that runs on a webserver, and can be accessed via a standard web browser, within which you can write and run code, make plots, and write notes, all on one place. This makes it particularly useful for lab work as you can document what you're doing as you do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document aims to give a very brief description, and some handy hints, to using a [Jupyter Notebook](#notebook) in your lab work. Here, I will only make reference to using a notebook with a Python [kernel](#kernel) (although kernels for [other languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) can be used!), but this will not provide a general introduction to Python, so for that you might want to look [elsewhere](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+tutorial+for+beginners). It is written particularly in mind of honours level undergraduate students in [Physics & Astronomy](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), and as such some comments will relate specifically them (which I'll highlight <span style=\"text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px lightgrey; border: 1px solid Azure; border-radius: 2px; background-color: Azure; box-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 2px SkyBlue;\">with a box</span>), although most of the document should be generally applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full documentation for Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io). For a far more comprehensive guide to using Jupyter Notebooks in a learning and teaching environment there is an online book called [_\"Teaching and Learning with Jupyter\"_](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/), which may be useful."

    "The dropdown menu options under the \"`Notebook:`\" title are the selection of different [kernels](#kernel) that you could run your notebook with. In particular, these kernels might include different version of Python, or could be based on [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) running with certain Python packages pre-installed. You may only have one option to choose from. To start a new notebook just click on the kernel you want to use.\n",

In general, if there is no preference suggested just use the \"Python 3\" kernel.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Note_: in the dropdown menu there is also an \"`Other:`\" title, from which you can: open an empty text file to just do normal text editing; create a new folder; open a Linux terminal window in your home directory.\n",

    "It should go without saying that backing up your work is **very important**! An important aspect of backing things up is having a history of how your work has progressed. This, in particular is useful for two (and probably many more) main reasons: i) you can go back and look at how you solved a problem, which can be useful when writing up you report, ii) if you muck something up, changes something you shouldn't have, or break your code in some way, then having a oft-backed-up history allows you to restore things to a state when they worked.\n",

    "When coding [Google](http://www.google.com) is your greatest friend. If you have a coding problem or question the chances are someone else has had that issue in the past, and they may well have asked the internet for help. If you can try and come up with a succinct sentence that describes your problem then typing that into Google may quickly give you an answer (becoming a [google-fu](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=google-fu) master can be tricky). Often that answer will come from a site such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which has a huge wealth of answers to all manner of coding questions. You should feel free to ask questions on StackOverflow yourself and you can often get an answer quite quickly - the community on there is usually nice, but unfortunetaly there are contributors who can be quite rude or snarky. If asking a question try to give as much information as possible about the nature of your problem, including a code snippet that would allow someone else to reproduce the problem if applicable (often known as a **m**inimal **w**orking **e**xample, or MWE). Try not to use it in a way that comes across as asking someone to _\"do my homework\"_, i.e., don't just say _\"I'm trying to write code for a Solar System simulator, can you tell me how?\"_.\n",
