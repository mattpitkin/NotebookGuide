    "# Using a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is a Jupyter Notebook? Well, to quote their [website](https://jupyter.org/) _\"[A] Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\"_. What this means is that it provides an application that runs on a webserver, and can be accessed via a standard web browser, within which you can write and run code, make plots, and write notes, all on one place. This makes it particularly useful for lab work as you can document what you're doing as you do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document aims to give a very brief description, and some handy hints, to using a [Jupyter Notebook](#notebook) in your lab work. Here, I will only make reference to using a notebook with a Python [kernel](#kernel) (although kernels for [other languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) can be used!), but this will not provide a general introduction to Python, so for that you might want to look [elsewhere](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+tutorial+for+beginners). It is written particularly in mind of honours level undergraduate students in [Physics & Astronomy](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), and as such some comments will relate specifically them (which I'll highlight <span style=\"text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0.5px lightgrey; border: 1px solid Azure; border-radius: 2px; background-color: Azure; box-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 2px SkyBlue;\">with a box</span>), although most of the document should be generally applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full documentation for Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io). For a far more comprehensive guide to using Jupyter Notebooks in a learning and teaching environment there is an online book called [_\"Teaching and Learning with Jupyter\"_](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/), which may be useful."

    "The dropdown menu options under the \"`Notebook:`\" title are the selection of different [kernels](#kernel) that you could run your notebook with. In particular, these kernels might include different version of Python, or could be based on [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) running with certain Python packages pre-installed. You may only have one option to choose from. To start a new notebook just click on the kernel you want to use.\n",

To change the title, and also the associated file name, just click on the area highlighted by the image above and write in the title you would like. It is important to chose a title/file name that makes it relatively easy for you to remember what is notebook contains.

Often that answer will come from a site such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which has a huge wealth of answers to all manner of coding questions. You should feel free to ask questions on StackOverflow yourself and you can often get an answer quite quickly - the community on there is usually nice, but unfortunetaly there are contributors who can be quite rude or snarky. If asking a question try to give as much information as possible about the nature of your problem, including a code snippet that would allow someone else to reproduce the problem if applicable (often known as a **m**inimal **w**orking **e**xample, or MWE).
